   * into 2 Quads(which will hopefully have pixels that are more similar to 
   * each other).
   *
   * To do this, first we need to decide in which direction we are going to 
   * split the Quad. For this, we will use the 'wsplit'field.
   *
   *    - If wsplit = 1, then we split it along the width (ie, we will now have 
   *                     2 quads with the same heightand half the width as the 
   *                     original one)

   *
   * NOTE: We don't always want to split the Quads in the same direction
   *       every time this function is called, because then we could just
   *       end up with very thin and long/tall quads, which wouldn't be very
   *       helpful to what we are trying to do. So, we need to make sure that
   *       once we split a Quad, that we invert the value of the 'wsplit'
   *       variable in both the new nodes, so they split the other way.
   *
   * -------------------------------------------------------------------------
   *
   * For example, if our Quad had the following values:
   *    (tx:ty = 0:0     w = 512,   h = 512,  wsplit = 1) ---> A
